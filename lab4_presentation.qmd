## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Coding sections
This would be a basic manipulation on penguins dataset in R
```{r penguins}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

penguins_nst <- penguins |> group_by(island, species) |> nest()
penguins
```

## Result display
This is the table of what the data would look like
```{r display dataset}
penguins_nst
```
